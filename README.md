# Sales Summary DashboardThis is a simple, single-page web application designed to fetch, parse, and display the total sales from a `data.csv` file. The UI is built to be responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS.## Features- **Data Fetching:** Asynchronously fetches `data.csv` from the same directory.- **CSV Parsing:** Processes the CSV content to identify and sum values from the 'sales' column.- **Dynamic Display:** Shows the calculated total sales in a prominent section of the page.- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-first, and responsive user interface.- **Dynamic Title:** Sets the browser tab title to 'Sales Summary Report' based on a predefined seed.## SetupTo run this application, ensure you have the following files in the same directory:- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application logic and UI.- `data.csv`: The data source with a column named 'sales' (case-insensitive).Once these files are in place, simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.## File Structure```text/.├── index.html├── data.csv├── README.md└── LICENSE```## UsageUpon opening `index.html`, the application will automatically attempt to fetch and process `data.csv`. The 'Total Sales' display will update from 'Loading...' to the calculated sum or an error message if any issues occur during data fetching or parsing.## Technologies- HTML5- JavaScript (Vanilla)- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
